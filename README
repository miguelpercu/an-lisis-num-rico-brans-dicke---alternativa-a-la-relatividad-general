Repository Update: Cosmological Analysis with Real Data (September 25, 2025, 01:50 AM -03)
Dear community,

I am pleased to announce a significant update to this repository, which hosts the Python code supporting the manuscript "Brans-Dicke vs. ΛCDM: A Comparative Cosmological Analysis" [previously submitted to a journal]. This version introduces a new implementation and results based on real observational data from the Pantheon Type Ia supernova catalog, enhancing the original analysis conducted with synthetic simulations. This update is released at 01:50 AM -03 on Thursday, September 25, 2025, as part of ongoing efforts to refine and validate the numerical framework.

Context and Objective
This study presents a numerical analysis of the Brans-Dicke (BD) cosmological model as an alternative to General Relativity (GR), specifically comparing it to the standard ΛCDM model. The original code, available in this repository, was developed to perform this comparison using synthetic simulations, where BD and ΛCDM were found to be statistically indistinguishable (Δχ² ≈ 0.064 for ω ≥ 10), as detailed in the manuscript. To align the analysis with real-world observations, the pipeline has been extended to process the 1048 data points from the Pantheon catalog \cite{Scolnic2018}, which includes redshifts ($0.01 < z < 2.3$), corrected apparent magnitudes ($m_B$) as a proxy for distance modulus μ(z), and associated errors.

Changes and New Results
The updated code (available as Python Pipeline for Real Data Analysis.ipynb) includes the following enhancements:

Real Data Loading and Processing: Uses pandas to read the lcparam_full_long.txt file from the official Pantheon repository, resolving syntax warnings (e.g., sep=r'\s+') and managing numerical singularities in luminosity distance integration.
Differential Equation Solving: Improves the BD equation implementation by refining the source term in bd_odes and dynamic terms in solve_brans_dicke (e.g., penalizing low ω with factors like 0.1 / (omega + 1)) to better align with observational constraints.
Statistical Analysis: Calculates the marginalized χ² for ΛCDM and BD across multiple ω values (10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000, 10000), producing comparative plots and exporting results to CSV files.
Key Results:
ΛCDM: χ² = 1037.18, reduced χ² = 0.991.
BD: χ² ranges from 1558.79 (ω=10) to 1700.17 (ω=10000), with a minimum at ω=10 (Δχ² = 521.611 compared to ΛCDM).
Conclusion: A significant difference (Δχ² >> 2√dof) rejects BD in favor of ΛCDM with real data, contrasting with the indistinguishability in simulations.
These findings are integrated into a new manuscript section titled "Analysis with Real Data," to be submitted as a revised version or addendum to the journal. The section includes a table with the results (see results/statistical_analysis/statistical_results.csv) and discusses the overfit at ω=10, its inconsistency with local constraints (ω > 40,000, Cassini \cite{Will2006}) and cosmological constraints (ω > 692, Planck \cite{Planck2018}), and the need for extensions like G/c co-variants \cite{Medeiros2023, BezerraSobrinho2025}.

Scientific Relevance
This update validates the numerical pipeline by applying it to real observational data, revealing a stark contrast with synthetic simulations. The rejection of BD (Δχ² = 521.611) underscores the limitations of the standard model when confronted with real-world noise and systematics, suggesting that extensions (e.g., variable G/c) may be necessary to reconcile BD with observations. This work also opens avenues for future studies integrating CMB and BAO data to explore BD's potential in addressing cosmological tensions, such as the H₀ discrepancy \cite{Riess2022}.
